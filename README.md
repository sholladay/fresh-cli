# fresh-cli [![Build status for Fresh CLI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/sholladay/fresh-cli/master.svg "Build Status")](https://circleci.com/gh/sholladay/fresh-cli "Builds") [![Build status for Fresh CLI on Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ll2n2qydyaeygiju/branch/master?svg=true "Windows Build Status")](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sholladay/fresh-cli "Windows Builds")

> Remove and reinstall your dependencies.

## Why?

 - Cross-platform support.
 - Works from any directory.
 - More reliable than `npm update`.
 - Includes nested dependencies, too.
 - Quick to type and easy to use.
 - Removes safely (cannot `rm -rf /`).

[npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) does a much better job creating a dependency tree from scratch than modifying an existing one without breaking anything. By reinstalling `node_modules`, you put yourself in a more well-known, consistent state.

This project works around many bugs:

 - [sindresorhus/find-up#16](https://github.com/sindresorhus/find-up/issues/16)
 - [npm/npm#17805](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17805)

Please add your own bugs to the list!
